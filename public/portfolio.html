                <h2>Mobile Ordering System</h2>
                <p class="short-desc">
                    Our Mobile Ordering System is a seamless, user-friendly platform that allows customers to order directly from their mobile devices. Designed with an intuitive UI, customers can easily browse the menu, select items, and customize their orders.
                </p>
                
                <div class="full-desc" style="display: none;">
                    <p>
                        The system integrates directly with our kiosk application, ensuring a unified ordering experience whether customers order via mobile or in-store.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Customers can choose between coffee, gelato, and other menu categories, with the ability to search the catalog and filter options based on their preferences. If an item offers multiple sizes or flavors, the system dynamically adjusts the selections, allowing for combinations such as choosing a second gelato flavor when ordering a double scoop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, it intelligently notifies customers if an item is only available for dine-in and not for takeout, reducing confusion and improving the ordering experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once customers finalize their selection, they proceed to the cart, where they can enter their name and pickup preferenceâ€”either curbside pickup or dine-in with a specified table number. The system then processes payments via Stripe API, ensuring secure and reliable transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon successful payment, customers are directed to a real-time order status page, where they can track progress as their order moves through the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For an enhanced experience, the system includes automated order tracking and real-time updates. When an order is received, it is managed through the order processing system, with notifications sent at each stage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, built-in geolocation tracking allows for automatic check-in when the customer is within a certain distance of the gelato shop, notifying the cashier to begin preparing the order. This ensures a smooth and efficient pickup process, improving both customer satisfaction and operational workflow.

                        Business hours are seamlessly integrated into the system, ensuring that when the store is closed, the display automatically switches to a <strong>"We Are Closed"</strong> page and returns to the main menu when open. This eliminates the need for manual updates and ensures customers always see the right information at the right time.
                    </p>

The dark mode toggle is implemented with state persistence via localStorage, ensuring that user preferences remain consistent across sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application is optimized for performance, leveraging Firestore indexing for fast data retrieval and ensuring minimal re-renders using efficient state management techniques.

                    AI Code Analyzer is an intelligent web-based tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o API to analyze and interpret source code. Designed for developers, this application provides detailed insights into code functionality, structure, and best practices. Users can submit code snippets, and the AI instantly evaluates them, explaining their purpose, identifying potential inefficiencies, and suggesting improvements.
